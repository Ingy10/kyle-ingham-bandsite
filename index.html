          <span class="main1__text-adjust1">The Bees Knees</span> </br></br> The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
          Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring
          two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a
          drummer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned
          act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
          experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
          confident the band could succeed even further with more support,
          pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.</br></br> From
          there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
          ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell
          in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying
          their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of
          this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive”
          and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The
          Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking
          to be released in early 2024.
